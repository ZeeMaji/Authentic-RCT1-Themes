# Authentic RCT1 Themes
A more accurate set of RCT1 themes for OpenRCT2
There are two different versions as the RCT1 base game and LL have slight interface differences, The base game theme is simply called "Authentic RCT1" while the LL theme is called "Authentic (RCT1 AA+LL)"
These themes aim to replicate both of these UI palettes as best as possible within the limits of OpenRCT2's theming system.
I've also taken the liberty of applying RCT1-esc colors to new windows added in RCT2 & OpenRCT2

Installation
Simply extract the jsons to your openrct2 themes folder

Differences (Both)
Opaque Bottom toolbar
Scenario/Track editor buttons are opaque & dark yellow
Fully brown options window (also shortcut key & theme & title sequencer editors)
Fully gray map window
Recent messages window buttons are gray
Load/Save windows & server list are gray
Extra view ports are gray (to match map window)
Track manager list is dark brown (to match track design selector)
Chat & console are dark red (like the red space between the top toolbar buttons in rct1)
Tile inspector is dark yellow (to match cheats window)

Differences (RCT1)
Opaque title menu buttons
Fully gray scenario selection window
Staff window colors are dark water rather than light purple

Things to note:
Due to the staff window in the rct1 theme using the dark water color, It's color will change depending on what water object is currently selected in the scenario (ex: orange water will make it orange)

Things that can't be replicated with these themes:
The dark red space between the top toolbar buttons in rct1
In the rct1 base game the "dark yellow" color was a different, brighter shade of yellow so it's not possible to replicate their colors within an openrct2 theme
